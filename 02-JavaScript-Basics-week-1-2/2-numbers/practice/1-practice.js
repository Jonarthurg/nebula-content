// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value
let x = 7

// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable
x *= 2
// x = x * 2

// Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(x)

// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together
const y = 4
const z = 40
// Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(y + z) 

// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest
const a = 15
const b = 4
const c = 6
const answer = a - (b + c)

//const answer = a - b - c        didnt use pemdas?

// Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(answer)


// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other
const even1 = 8
const even2 = 10
const answer1 = even2 / even1

// // Check it worked by logging to the console
console.log(answer1)

// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply them together
// Check it worked by logging to the console
const zeta = 11
const theta = 21
const answerOdd = zeta * theta
console.log(answerOdd)

// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console 
const pr = 25
console.log(pr % 3)

// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?

10 % 2 // if remainder is 0, number is even
13 % 2 // if remainder is 1, number is odd
