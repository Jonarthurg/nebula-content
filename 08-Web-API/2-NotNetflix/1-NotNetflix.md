* (Repeat) Review Promises

* Build a project with [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
  * Minimum requirements:
    * Build a wireframe
    * Access information from TMDB API

    * Have a landing page which displays 'generic' information such as different movie sections:
      * Trending
      * Action
      * Comedy

    * The following is the hard part:
      - TMDB DOESNT have trailers so you'll need to incorporate the YouTube Search API with the TMDB api 
      * Render cards for each movie or show
        * That card should have a play button
        * The play button should play a trailer for the movie - a simple embed will do for MVP but there is a player API that can be utilized if desired 

## Hint:
> FOCUS ON FUNCTIONALITY
> * Work on setting up a request that generates cards based on a specific request
> * Then ensure each card displays the right information
> * Then work on making a reqest to find a trailer from YouTube
Once this is all setup look to spend some time desiging your application. We have had students in the past build very unique looking websites from near-perfect Netflix replicas, to a "Blockbuster version" and one that started playing default trailers in the background while you were using the website. Think about what you'd like while you're working on functionality & jot down your ideas in a readme or something similar.
