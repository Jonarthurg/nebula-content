/* 
Given the following class that can create shapes, write an extension which will calculate the Surface Area and Volume of a given shape. 
Note, one class extension will likely not be able to handle all shapes, you'll have to extend shape for each unique shape
Log to the console a sentnece about your shape:
`Given a cylander of 2 height and 2 width. It will have a volume of 6.28 and a surface area of 18.84.` 
*/

// Extend 4 classes off of shapes
// Rectangle(A=bh), Triangle(A=1/2bh), Circle(A=Ï€r2) and Trapezoid(A=1/2h(b1+b2))
// Have methods to find the areas of the differnt shapes
